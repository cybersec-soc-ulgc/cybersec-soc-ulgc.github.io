Welcome to the Christmas Special Event by Cybersecurity Society ULGC. This Christmas, solve some easy-peasy challenges and win cute gifts!

#### How it works:

- Challenges will be released here and on the Discord server. 
- All challenges will be released on **`Christmas Eve @ 3:00 PM BST`**.
- All challenges are beginner friendly, we want you to have fun and learn something new!
- This event resembles a CTF, once you solve a challenge you will get a flag in the format `christmas_carol{flag}`. This is the "answer" of the challenge.

#### Flag submission process:
- Once you have solved all challenges, submit the flags in the `Google Form` shared alongwith the challenges.
- People with 100% correct solves will win super cute gifts! These gifts include a cool banner with your name/username to post on Linkedin and a badge to use on your profile picture.
- Some challenges do not give you the flag even after solving it since it will be too easy. Once you solve such a challenge, ping `@ghalibluvr` on Discord and we will give you the flag.


That's it! Have fun, stay healthy, keep an eye out on Discord for Christmas Eve and **Merry Christmas** 🎄🎅☃️
